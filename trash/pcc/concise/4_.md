# WORKING WITH LISTS

## Looping Through an Entire List

use `for` loop to do same action with every item in a list

```python
magicians = ['alice', 'david', 'carolina']

for magician in magicians:
   
for magician in magicians[:2]:
```

- tip `for cat in cats:`  this naming conventions can help you follow



## Doing More Work within a for loop

Python is `indention` sensitive 

## Making Numerical Lists

Lists are ideal for storing sets of numbers, and Python provides a number of tools to help you work efficiently with lists of numbers.

- function`Range(start,end,adds)` : returns iterable set of numbers

## Functions with numbers

- `max(digits)`: returns maximum
- `min(digits)`: returns minimum
- `sum(digits)`: return sum

## List Comprehensions

```python
sqaures = [value ** 2 for value in range(1,11)]
```



## Working With Part of a List

You can work with a specific group of items in a list, which Python calls a **slice**

## Slicing a List

- `list[start index(omit=first) : end index(omit=end)]`



## Copying a List

To copy a list, you can make a slice that includes the entire original list by omitting the first index and the second index `[:]`.



## Tuples

Python refers to value that cannot change `immutable`

- `Tuple` : immutable list

- you can Lopping Through all values in a tuple just like list

- will occur `TypeError` If you're trying to alter a tuple `tuple[0] = value`

- Altough you can't modify a tuple, you can assign a new value to a variable that holds a tuple.
