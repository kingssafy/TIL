We name this new method test_first_last_middle_name(). The method name must start
with  test_ so the method runs automically when we run test_
name_function.py. We name the method to make it clear which behavior of `get_formatted_name()`
we're testing . As a result, if the test fails, we know right away what kinds of mnames are affected. It's 
fine to have long method names in your `Testcase`
