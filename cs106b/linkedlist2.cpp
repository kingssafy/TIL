// Structs
// C++ has an entity called a structure(struct)
// - Very similar to a class; a collection of data and (maybe) behavior.
// But has (by default) public member variables and no functions
/*
 * struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
 
 }
 point p;
 p.x;
*/
// A holdover from C, which did not have classes or objects
// Sometimes used for lightweight objects without encapsulation.
// struct ListNode{
// int data;
// ListNode* next;
// }
#include <iostream>
